# WalletRadar Domain

WalletRadar is a **DeFi wallet analytics platform** focused on cost basis tracking and portfolio statistics.

## Core Purpose

Track and compute the **average purchase price** (average cost methodology) of assets held in DeFi wallets based on **on-chain transaction analysis**, with support for **manual adjustments**.

## Domain Focus

- **Deep analysis of on-chain activity** — parse and interpret blockchain transactions
- **Accurate cost basis computation** — average cost methodology, not FIFO/LIFO
- **Liquidity pool (LP) profitability and exit analysis** — LP positions and exit valuation
- **Multi-wallet, multi-network aggregation** — support multiple wallets and chains

When implementing features or reviewing code, align with this domain: prioritize on-chain accuracy, cost basis correctness, and LP/portfolio analytics.
