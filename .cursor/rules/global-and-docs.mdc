## Documentation Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/00-context.md` | Product context, goals, not goals, limitations |
| `docs/01-domain.md` | Entities, glossary, invariants |
| `docs/02-architecture.md` | Modules architecture, data flow |
| `docs/03-accounting.md` | Cost basis policy (AVG), PnL, costs |
| `docs/04-api.md` | API contract or link to OpenAPI spec |
| `docs/adr/*.md` | Architecture Decision Records — **one ADR per file**; each ADR must explain **why** and **when** the decision was made |

When creating or updating docs, place content in the correct file and keep ADRs focused (one decision, one file).
