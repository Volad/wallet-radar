# Build and Repository

## Build tool

- **Backend:** **Gradle** (not Maven). Use Gradle for the Spring Boot backend: `build.gradle.kts` in `backend/`, **Gradle Wrapper at project root** (`./gradlew`). Run backend tasks from repo root, e.g. `./gradlew :backend:test`, `./gradlew :backend:bootRun`, `./gradlew :backend:build`.
- **Frontend:** npm/yarn for Angular; may be orchestrated from root Gradle or standalone (see monorepo layout).

## Repository layout: monorepo

- The repository follows a **monorepo** approach: **backend** and **frontend** live in the same repo.
- **Layout (mandatory):**
  - **Backend** — under a single root or a dedicated subdirectory (e.g. `backend/` or root with `backend` as Gradle subproject). All Java/Spring Boot code, Gradle build.
  - **Frontend** — under a dedicated subdirectory (e.g. `frontend/`). Angular app, its own `package.json` and build.
- Root may contain:
  - Root Gradle build that includes `backend` (and optionally orchestrates `frontend`), or
  - Separate `backend/` and `frontend/` with no root build (each built separately).
- **Do not** use Maven for the backend; do not split backend and frontend into separate repositories for MVP.

When creating or modifying the project structure, bootstrap with **Gradle** for backend and keep **frontend** in the same repo under its own directory.
